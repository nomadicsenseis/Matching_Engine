# Matching_Engine
In this code I implement a pretrained SBERT model, alongside a classical tf-idf algorithm (BM25), on an information retrieval task. I play around with the architectures, and I compare the results using classical Information retrieval metrics. I also parallelize the computations building an Apache Beam pipeline.
